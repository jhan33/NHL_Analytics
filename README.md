# NHL_Analytics

The goal of this project will be to investigate scoring trends in the National Hockey Leagure (NHL) by shooting trends.

The project utilizes Google Apps Script, a cloud based Javascript platform, to extract data from an NHL statistics API.

The API can be found here: https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi

Data on "goals" and "shots" shooting coordinates are extracted for Exploratory Data Analysis.
